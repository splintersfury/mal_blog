Hello! I'm Ahmad. For over five years, I've been deeply immersed in the world of cybersecurity, specializing in **advanced malware analysis, reverse engineering, and incident response**. This blog is where I aim to share insights and experiences from the front lines of combating digital threats.

My primary role is as a **Technical Lead in Malware Analysis and Incident Response at the Cyber Security Agency of Singapore (CSA)**. Within the National Cyber Incident Response Centre (NCIRC), I lead the comprehensive, end-to-end handling of malware incidents. This involves a meticulous process: from the critical initial triage and deep-dive static/dynamic analysis of malicious software to the intricate art of **reverse engineering complex threats** to understand their core functionalities and impact. A key part of my work is translating these technical findings into actionable threat intelligence, detailed reports, and strategic escalations. I'm also heavily involved in **developing automated analysis pipelines and standardized procedures** to enhance our response capabilities and efficiency in dissecting new and evolving malware.

**Why this blog?**

My goal with this blog is to:
* Delve into the technical nuances of **malware analysis and reverse engineering** cases (always anonymized and handled ethically).
* Share practical **incident response strategies** and lessons learned.
* Discuss tools, techniques, and automation approaches that can aid fellow cybersecurity professionals.
* Chronicle interesting challenges and my ongoing journey in the world of cybersecurity defense.

I'm always eager to learn and connect with others in this field.
